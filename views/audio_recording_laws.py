Voice and Video Recordings under Georgia law Recording Telephone Conversations Per O.C.G.A. 16-11-66, you can record a telephone conversation in Georgia if you are a party to the conversation (on the phone). The recording will typically be admissible evidence at any hearing or trial. Therefore, if you and your spouse are having a telephone conversation, it is legal for you to record the conversation under Georgia law. The problem is one spouse can provoke a fight then turn on a recorder. Both spouses should be mindful that a recording could be running any time they are speaking on the phone. Insults and profanity can have a significant negative impact if played before a judge or jury.

You cannot, however, record a conversation if you are not a party, such as the situation where you record your spouse in a conversation with a boyfriend or girlfriend. See, Middleton v. Middleton, 259 Ga. 41, 376 S.E.2d 368 (1989). In this case, the husband secured a recording of the wife discussing her affair with her boyfriend and their plans to marry after the divorce. Because the husband was not a party to the conversation, the recording was inadmissible for direct evidence of the affair. However, there was no sanction to the husband for securing the information, and the court held open the question of whether the tape could have been used on cross examination for impeachment purposes.

Audio, Video or Photographic Surveillance There has been some confusion in Georgia law regarding whether a spouse can make a surreptitious video recording of another while in the marital residence. In 2013, the Supreme Court answered the question in the negative. See, Rutter v. Rutter, 294 Ga. 1 (2013) (The Supreme Court held there is no marital residence exception to the general rule found in O.C.G.A. section 16-11-62 that a party may not secretly observe, photograph or record the activities of another in a private place.)

The Court of Appeals had previously found an exception involving the "curtilage" of the marital residence (apparently meaning the marital residence and the immediate surrounding land), which created confusion until the Supreme Court ruled. It is noted, however, that the legislature could always insert this exception. But, for now, a spouse is safe from exposure to a surreptitiously recording while he or she is in the marital residence that could be used in court.
