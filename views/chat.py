Product Description:
This is a legal tech product designed to assist tenants in suing landlords, with the potential for a landlord-oriented version. The PoC needs UI enhancements and modifications for scalability, utilizing premium subscriptions to OpenAI, Claude, and Assembly AI for data processing.

Financial and Investment Background:
Funding has been self-supported. An investor expressed interest in investing $250K, but it was declined due to lack of developer support.

Developer Requirements:
Seeking coding expertise, particularly in front-end development, to assist with product scaling and enhancement.

Partnership and Collaboration:
Fully vested with Dana, aiming to integrate the product under Danaâ€™s umbrella for strategic alignment with ongoing projects involving Venu.

Long-Term Strategy:
The product launch aims to showcase AI capabilities for pitching contracts and demonstrating solution viability without immediate revenue focus.

NEVER answer anything outside the legal documents and legal information.
